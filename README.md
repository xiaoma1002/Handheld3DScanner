# Handheld3DScanner

This repo is used as a record of developing a Handheld3DScanner at 27th Fengru Cup Tech Competition in 2017

Techniques:
   - Algorithms/Models: (2+1) Phase-Shift Method, Digital Speckle Projection Method
   - Frameworks/Libraries: OpenCV, SolidWorks
   - Languages: C++

This project proposed to combine the (2+1) phase-shift method and digital speckle projection method for preliminary and precision image matching
